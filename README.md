### Environment Variables

The backend requires a few secret keys to run.

1.  In your **backend folder**, create a new file named `.env`.
2.  Open the `.env` file and add the following variables, replacing the placeholder values with your actual keys:

    ```
    # Your MongoDB connection string from Atlas
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/yourDatabaseName
    
    # A long, random string for signing tokens

    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need to have two terminals open to run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.

1.  **Run the Backend (Server):**
    Open a terminal, navigate to your **backend folder**, and run:
    ```sh
    # Make sure you are inside the backend folder
    node server.js
    ```
    The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend (React App):**
    Open a **second** terminal, navigate to your **frontend folder**, and run:
    ```sh
    # Make sure you are inside the frontend folder
    npm start
